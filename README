Known issues:

- Using this library in OCaml interactive mode can lead to a crash:

        Objective Caml version 3.12.1

# open Efl;;
# Elm.init Sys.argv;;
WARNING: gnome-keyring:: couldn't connect to: /tmp/keyring-INmpHp/pkcs11: No such file or directory
- : unit = ()
# let win = Elm_win.add "hello" `basic;;
Erreur de segmentation (core dumped)

- Some examples do not work for native compilation.

Currently, the best way to avoid these problems is to set the environement
variable EVAS_CPU_NO_SSE3 to 1:

export EVAS_CPU_NO_SSE3=1

An other way is configuring evas with --disable-cpu-sse3.
